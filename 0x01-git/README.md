# Creating the 1st directory in our ALX Pre-course repo.

In this directory we will handle some interesting tasks. 
We Will start off with *creating 3 directories* which will have in them some files just to showcase how we can use **git** properly.
Then we will do some changes on the files while **maintaining changes** in _both branches_. And we will try to do a hot fix. (updated)
